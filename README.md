# odin-recipes

## Before project completed

First odin project to practice basics again to derust!

Before this, I quickly went over how to create boilerplate HTML files, tags such as html, head, meta, title, body, header, paragraph, emphasis, strong, and ordered/unordered lists.

## After project completed

I was able to quickly complete this project and get through it fairly quickly using the basics of HTML. Finally memorized the HTML boilerplate so I will go back to using the shortcut for VSCode to quickly implement boilerplate going forward. Working on CSS basics next.
